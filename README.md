# !random collection of script's to get started with very basic consepts of game development
ImTooLazyToBeAGoodDeveloperPerhapsThatsWhyILoveSecurityHaveTheseOldScriptsHopeTheyHelp/Are Enjoyed

So this here is a bad collection of the script's that I starting writing/wrote a few years ago, and to be honest; 
I just got bored and found another idea(s) that where more interesting to me at the timme. I  hope it help's someone, even if that 
is just laughing at the code. The code just sat around having nothing working on it and with me doing other things; 
but anyway, please enjoy.

Edit (05/09/20):

I have come to see that despite being an aweful developer: I actually really enjoy it.

Honetly I originaly thaught that this would just be something that was left out on the internet; people would lol at, and I would forget that I even wrote it; let alone published it on the internet! But I'm having fun with a new program that I will post in the comeing weeks; so figured I may aswell edit this code so as to not be quite as aweful. 

Enjoy.
