# !random collection of script's to get started with very basic consepts of game development
ImTooLazyToBeAGoodDeveloperPerhapsThatsWhyILoveSecurityHaveTheseOldScriptsHopeTheyHelp/Are Enjoyed

So this here is a bad collection of the script's that I starting writing/wrote a few years ago, and to be honest; 
I just got bored and found another idea that was more interesting to me. I  hope it help's someone, even if that 
is just laughing at the code. The code just sat around having nothing working on it and with me doing other things; 
but anyway, please enjoy.
